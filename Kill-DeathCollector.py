## Kill death collector is going to be a script that will scan the recent games and sstrictly collect the kills and locations of the kills
## will probably need to filter out the matches that are not ranked and matches that are not close (13-0 , 13-6 will not be collected as they are not representative)
## will need to collect ranks to see differences between rank play style
## right now am not collecting agents but in future agents will need to be collected
