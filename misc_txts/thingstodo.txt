might need to add an api call to get map stuff
check out https://dash.valorant-api.com/endpoints/maps

NEED DOCUMENTATION ON EVERYTHING THIS IS SUPPOSED TO DO

Rate limiting needs to be figured out       done-ish?? pretty inconsistent
maybe all this api work was for nothing bc other packages do it. however they dont do it like im doing is so imma leave it

gotta get a V1.0 DOCUMENTATION written. prob just gonna be heat map overlays matched against economics
